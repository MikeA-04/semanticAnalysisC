# Semantic Analysis for C in F#
This F# project performs simple semantic analysis of C programs.\
This project has a modified parser and lexer to include real values. The analyzer and checker are completely written from scratch.\
\
Note 1: The obj folder contains all the test C files written by Prof. Joe Hummel of the U. of Illinois, Chicago.\
Note 2: All test cases have been passed by this project.\
Note 3: This respository includes my own parser file from a previous project that is not compatible with this project.
