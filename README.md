# Semantic Analysis for C in F#
This F# project performs simple semantic analysis of C programs.\
This project has a modified parser and lexer to include real values. The analyzer and checker are completely written from scratch.\
\
Note: This respository includes my own parser file from a previous project that is not compatible with this project.
